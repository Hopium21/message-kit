## Most common bug
  Some times you will say something like: "Looks like vitalik.eth is registered! What about these cool alternatives?"
  But you forgot to add the command at the end of the message.
  You should have said something like: "Looks like vitalik.eth is registered! What about these cool alternatives?\n/cool vitalik.eth
