# Structure

## File structure

Each bot consists of the following files:

```
bot-project/              # Optional middleware files
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts          # Entry point for your bot. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ commands.ts       # Commands for your bot. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json         // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
â””â”€â”€ .env                  # Environment variables
```

## Logic

The `index.ts` file is the entry point for your bot. It should contain something like the following:

```jsx [src/index.ts]
import "dotenv/config";
import { run, HandlerContext } from "@xmtp/botkit";

run(async (context: HandlerContext) => {
  // Get the message and the address from the sender
  const { content, senderAddress } = context.message;

  // To reply, just call `reply` on the HandlerContext.
  await context.reply(`gm`);
});
```

## Commands

Each bot can have a `commands.ts` file that contains the availble commands for the users. The commands are defined as an array of objects with the following structure:

```tsx [src/commands.ts]
export const commands = [
  {
    name: "General Commands",
    icon: "ðŸ”§",
    description: "Command for managing default behaviours.",
    commands: [
      {
        command: "/help",
        description: "Get help with the bot.",
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

## Environment variables

Each bot should have an `.env` file that contains the following:

```bash [.env]
KEY= # 0x... the private key of the bot (with the 0x prefix)
XMTP_ENV=production # or `dev`
```
