# Commands

Each bot can have a `commands.ts` file that contains the commands that the bot can execute. The commands are defined as an array of objects with the following keys:

## Create commands

Create the command file `commands.ts` in your project root `src` folder.

```tsx [src/commands.ts]
export const commands = [
  {
    name: "General Commands",
    icon: "ðŸ”§",
    description: "Command for managing default behaviours.",
    commands: [
      {
        command: "/help",
        description: "Get help with the bot.",
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

## Declare commands

To declare the access command in the app, you need to add the following code:

```tsx
import { commands } from "./commands.js";

const newBotConfig = {
  context: {
    commands: commands,
  },
};

run(async (context: HandlerContext) => {
  //Your logic here
}, newBotConfig);
```
