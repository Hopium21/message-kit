# Replies

With XMTP, replies are represented as objects with the following keys:

```tsx
{
  reference: someMessageID, //ID of the message being replied to
  contentType: ContentTypeText, //Content type of the reply
  content: "I concur", //String representation of the reply
  receiver: address, //Address of the user who received the reply
};
```

### Receive a reply

Now that you understand how replies are represented, you can receive them in your app. Here's an example of how you can receive a reply in your app:

```tsx
const { content, typeId } = context.message;

if (typeId == "reply") {
  const { content: reply, receiver } = content;
  // Use reply...
}
```
