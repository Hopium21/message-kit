# Bot message

Bot messages are messages that are sent by a bot to a user or a group of users and are highlighted differently by the apps.

```tsx
// Message to all users
context.reply("Sender or receiver not found.");

//Message to specific user/users
context.reply("Sender or receiver not found.");
(
  `You received ${amount} DEGEN tokens from ${sender.username}. Your new balance is ${receiver.degen} DEGEN tokens.`,
  addresses, // Array of addresses to send the message to
);
```

### Receive a bot message

Bot messages are prevented from being sent to the bot itself
