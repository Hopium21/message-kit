# Silent

For special uses cases where the app needs to send commands to a bot without being displayed in the app, botkit receives a `silent` request with this structure

```tsx
{
  content: "command",
  metadata: {}
}
```

### Receive an silent message

This example shows how recieve a silent message and grant access to a user

```jsx
const { content, contentType, senderAddress } = context.message;
const { typeId } = contentType;

if (typeId == "silent") {
  const { content: command } = content;
  // Do something with the command
}
```
