# Groups

Included with the context you will get the `conversation` object and the `client` object.

```tsx
const { client, conversation } = context;
```

## Create a new group

Using the client you can create a new group with an array of addresses.

```tsx
const group = await client.conversations.newGroup(addresses);
```

## Sync a group

Each time you perform an action on a group you must sync it to get the latest state.

```tsx
await group.sync();
```

## Group metadata

> You need admin privileges to update the metadata.

Groups have the following metadata:

### Group name

You can update the name of the group chat.

```tsx
// get the name
const groupName = group.name;
// update the name
await group.updateName(name);
```

### Group description

You can update the description of the group chat.

```tsx
// get the description
const groupDescription = group.description;
// update the description
await group.updateDescription(description);
```

### Group image

You can update the image of the group chat.

```tsx
// get the image
const groupImage = group.imageUrl;
// update the image
await group.updateImageUrl(imageUrl);
```

## Member management

> You need admin privileges to manage members.

You can add or remove members from a group.

### Remove members from a group

```tsx
//By address
await group.removeMembers(userAddresses);
//By inboxId
await group.removeMembersByInboxId(removedInboxes);
```

### Add members to a group

```tsx
//By address
await group.addMembers(userAddresses);
//By inboxId
await group.addMembersByInboxId(addedInboxes);
```

## Messages

To get the message history in a group you can use the `messages` property.

```tsx
// sync group first
await group.sync();
// get messages
const messages = group.messages();
```

To see the full extent of groups refer to XMTP's [Group documentation](https://xmtp.org/docs/build/group-chat).
