# Groups

:::warning

- Group features are currently in beta and are subject to change. See XMTP's [docs](https://docs.xmtp.org/groups/build-group-chat).

## Guidelines

:::info
We don't encourage using the XMTP SDK to manage groups in non-inbox applications.
:::

Make sure you follow the [guidelines](/guidelines) for building responsible group bots on XMTP.

## Add members to a group

:::info

- You need admin privileges to manage members.

:::

```tsx
// get the group
const { group } = context;
await group.sync();
//By address
await group.addMembers(userAddresses);
//By inboxId
await group.addMembersByInboxId(addedInboxes);
```

## Added member

When a member is added to a group it will emit a `group_updated` event with a `addedInboxes` array containing the addresses of the users added.

```tsx
if (typeId === "group_updated") {
  const { addedInboxes } = context.message.content;

  if (addedInboxes?.length > 0) {
    for (const inbox of addedInboxes) {
      console.log(`User added: ${inbox.inboxId}`);
    }
  }
}
```
