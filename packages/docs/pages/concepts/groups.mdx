## Member management

:::info
You need admin privileges to manage members.
:::

You can add or remove members from a group.

### Remove members from a group

```tsx
// get the group
const { group } = context;
await group.sync();
//By address
await group.removeMembers(userAddresses);
//By inboxId
await group.removeMembersByInboxId(removedInboxes);
```

### Removed member

When a member is removed from a group it will emit a `group_updated` event with a `removedInboxes` array containing the addresses of the users removed.

```tsx
if (typeId === "group_updated") {
  const { removedInboxes } = context.message.content;
  if (removedInboxes?.length > 0) {
    for (const inbox of removedInboxes) {
      console.log(`User removed: ${inbox.inboxId}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### Add members to a group

```tsx
// get the group
const { group } = context;
await group.sync();
//By address
await group.addMembers(userAddresses);
//By inboxId
await group.addMembersByInboxId(addedInboxes);
```

### Added member

When a member is added to a group it will emit a `group_updated` event with a `addedInboxes` array containing the addresses of the users added.

```tsx
if (typeId === "group_updated") {
  const { addedInboxes } = context.message.content;

  if (addedInboxes?.length > 0) {
    for (const inbox of addedInboxes) {
      console.log(`User added: ${inbox.inboxId}`);
    }
  }
}
```
