## Group updated object

The `group_updated` type contains the following

```tsx
{
  initiatedByInboxId: address, // Address of the user who initiated the update
  metadataFieldChanges: Record<string, string>[], // Record of metadata fields that changed
  removedInboxes: string[], // Array of addresses of users removed from the group
  addedInboxes: string[], // Array of addresses of users added to the group
}
```

## Membership update

Receive a `group_updated` event when a group membership changes.

### Added member

When a member is added to a group it will emit a `group_updated` event with a `addedInboxes` array containing the addresses of the users added.

```tsx
if (typeId === "group_updated") {
  const { addedInboxes } = context.message.content;

  if (addedInboxes?.length > 0) {
    for (const inbox of addedInboxes) {
      console.log(`User added: ${inbox.inboxId}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### Removed member

When a member is removed from a group it will emit a `group_updated` event with a `removedInboxes` array containing the addresses of the users removed.

```tsx
if (typeId === "group_updated") {
  const { removedInboxes } = context.message.content;
  if (removedInboxes?.length > 0) {
    for (const inbox of removedInboxes) {
      console.log(`User removed: ${inbox.inboxId}`);
    }
  }
}
```

## Metadata update

When a group name is changed it will emit a `group_updated` event with a `metadataFieldChanges` array containing the new group name.

Metadata events:

- `group_name`: The name of the group
- `group_description`: The description of the group
- `group_image_url_square`: The square image of the group

```tsx
if (typeId === "group_updated") {
  const { metadataFieldChanges } = context.message.content;

  if (metadataFieldChanges?.length > 0) {
    for (const change of metadataFieldChanges) {
      const { fieldName, oldValue, newValue } = change;
      console.log(`Value ${fieldName} changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}`);
    }
  }
}
```
