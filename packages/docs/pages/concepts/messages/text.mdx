# Text

With XMTP, text is represented as objects with the following keys:

## Text object

The `text` type contains the following

```tsx
const {
  message: {
    content: {
      text, // The content of the message
    },
    typeId: "text",
  },
};
```

- `text`: string - _The content of the message_

## Receive a text message

Here's an example of how you can receive a `text` message in your app:

```tsx
if (typeId === "text") {
  const { text } = content;
  // Use text
}
```
