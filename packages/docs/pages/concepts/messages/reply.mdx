# Replies

With XMTP, replies are represented as objects with the following keys:

## Reply object

The `reply` type contains the following

```tsx
const {
  messae: {
    content: {
      reference: someMessageID; //ID of the message being replied to
      reply: "I concur"; //String representation of the reply
      replyChain: [someMessageID], //Array of message IDs that are part of the reply chain
    },
    typeId: "reply",
  }
} = context;
```

- `reference`: string, // ID of the message being replied to
- `reply`: string, // String representation of the reply
- `replyChain`: string[], // Array of message IDs that are part of the reply chain

## Receive a reply

Now that you understand how replies are represented, you can receive them in your app. Here's an example of how you can receive a reply in your app:

```tsx
if (typeId === "reply") {
  // Use reply...
}
```
