# Conversations

Included with the context you will get the `conversation` object and the `client` object.

```tsx
const { client, conversation } = context;
```

## Create a new conversation

Using the client you can create a new group or one-to-one conversation with an array of addresses.

```tsx
const conversation = await client.conversations.newConversation(addresses);
```

## Sync a conversation

Each time you perform an action on a conversation you must sync it to get the latest state.

```tsx
await conversation.sync();
```

## Update a conversation name

You can update the name of the group chat.

> ðŸ”’ You need admin privileges to update the name.

```tsx
// get the name
const groupName = group.name;
// update the name
await conversation.updateName(name);
```

## Member management

You can add or remove members from a conversation.

### Remove members from a conversation

```tsx
//By address
await conversation.removeMembers(userAddresses);
//By inboxId
await conversation.removeMembersByInboxId(removedInboxes);
```

### Add members to a conversation

```tsx
//By address
await conversation.addMembers(userAddresses);
//By inboxId
await conversation.addMembersByInboxId(addedInboxes);
```

## Messages

To get the message history in a conversation you can use the `messages` property.

```tsx
// sync group first
await group.sync();
// get messages
const messages = group.messages();
```
