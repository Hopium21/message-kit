# Replies

With XMTP, replies are represented as objects with the following keys:

## Reply object

The `reply` type contains the following

```tsx
{
  reference: someMessageID, //ID of the message being replied to
  contentType: ContentType, // type of the reply
  content: "I concur", //String representation of the reply
  referenceInboxId: address, //Address of the user who received the reply
};
```

## Receive a reply

Now that you understand how replies are represented, you can receive them in your app. Here's an example of how you can receive a reply in your app:

```tsx
const { content, typeId } = context.message;

if (typeId === "reply") {
  const { content: reply, referenceInboxId } = content;
  // Use reply...
}
```
