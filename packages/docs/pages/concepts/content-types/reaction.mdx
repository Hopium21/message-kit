# Reactions

With XMTP, reactions are represented as objects with the following keys:

## Reaction object

The `reaction` type contains the following

```tsx
{
  reference: message.id, //ID of the message being reacted to
  schema: "unicode", //Schema of the reaction (Unicode, shortcode, or custom)
  action: action, //Action of the reaction (added or removed)
  content: emoji, //String representation of the reaction (smile, for example) to be interpreted by clients
  referenceInboxId: address, //Address of the user who received the reaction
};
```

## Receive a reaction

Now that you understand how reactions are represented, you can receive them in your app. Here's an example of how you can receive a reaction in your app:

```tsx
const { content, typeId } = context.message;

if (typeId == "reaction") {
  const { action, content: emoji, receiver } = content;
  // Use reaction...
}
```
