# Images

With XMTP, images are represented as objects with the following keys:

## Image object

The `remoteStaticAttachment` type contains the following

```tsx
{
  url: // URL of the image
  filename: //   Name of the file
  contentDigest: // content digest
  salt: // salt
  nonce: // nonce
  secret: // secret
  scheme: // scheme
  contentLength: // content length
}
```

## Receive an image

Now that you understand how images are represented, you can receive them in your app. Here's an example of how you can receive an image in your app:

```tsx
const { content, typeId } = context.message;

if (typeId === "remoteStaticAttachment") {
  const { url, filename } = content;
  // Use image...
}
```
