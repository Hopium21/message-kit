# Intent

MessageKit **Intent** allows bots to interpret and execute commands internally, giving them the ability to process user requests in a conversational manner.

## Explicit commands

Explicit commands are directly handled by the bot through a well-defined [structure](/concepts/commands). The bot uses the parameters provided to trigger specific actions.

### Example:

A user wants to swap tokens:

```bash
/swap 1 eth usdc
```

MessageKit directly processes the parameters from the command and handles the parameters to return a Frame URL.

### Declaring commands

```tsx
import { HandlerContext } from "@xmtp/message-kit";
import { handleSwap } from "./handler/swap.js";

export const commands: CommandGroup[] = [
  {
    name: "Swap Bot",
    description: "Swap bot for base.",
    commands: [
      {
        command: "/swap [amount] [token_from] [token_to]",
        handler: handleSwap,
        triggers: ["/swap", "@swap", "@swapbot"],
        description: "Exchange one cryptocurrency for another.",
        params: {
          amount: { type: "number", default: 1 },
          token_from: { type: "string", values: ["eth", "usdc", "dai"] },
          token_to: { type: "string", values: ["eth", "usdc", "dai"] },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

### Handling command responses

MessageKit will automatically handle the command parameters allowing you to focus on handling the command logic.

```tsx
import { HandlerContext } from "@xmtp/message-kit";

export async function handleSwap(context: HandlerContext) {
  const {
    message: {
      content: { command, params }, // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
    },
  } = context;
  const baseUrl = "https://{url}";

  if (command === "swap") {
    const { amount, token_from, token_to } = params; // [!code hl] // [!code focus]

    if (!amount || !token_from || !token_to) {
      context.reply(
        "Missing required parameters. Please provide amount, token_from, and token_to.",
      );
      return;
    }
    // Generate URL for the swap transaction
    let url_swap = generateFrameURL(baseUrl, "swap", {
      amount,
      token_from,
      token_to,
    });
    context.reply(`${url_swap}`);
  }
}
```

The bot will reply with the URL to the swap transaction.

```bash
{baseUrl}/swap?amount=1&token_from=eth&token_to=usdc
```

## Natural language

Bots can also understand natural language prompts, allowing users to interact with the bot more conversationally. The bot translates the user's natural language input into a command and executes it.

### Example:

A user types:

```bash
@swap 1 usdc to eth please
```

The message will trigger an AI text generation model to convert the natural language to a command.

```bash
You are a helpful and playful betting bot that lives inside a web3 messaging group.

Users can start a swap by tagging you in a prompt like "@swap 1 eth to usdc"

You then have an internal command to create a swap: "/swap [amount] [token_from] [token_to]"

Format examples:
/swap 1 eth usdc
/swap 100 dai usdc
/swap 0.1 eth usdt
```

The AI model will return this command:

```bash
/swap 1 usdc eth
```

And then the bot using `intent` will execute the command. Internally MessageKit will execute the handler `handleSwap` for the command as defined in the commands file seen before.

```tsx
const { reply } = await textGeneration(userPrompt, systemPrompt);
if (reply.startsWith("/")) {
  // Execute the command if it's a slash command
  await context.intent(reply);
}
```

## Reasoning (Multiple Commands)

Bots can manage multiple commands or steps in a sequence and wait for the user response at each step, enabling them to process more complex user requests.

### Example:

A user interacts with the ENS bot:

```bash
lets register fabriethsf.eth
```

We already have the commands defined:

```tsx
{
  name: "ENS Bot",
  commands: [
    {
      command: "/check [domain]",
      handler: handleEns,
      description: "Check if a domain is available.",
    },
    {
      command: "/register [domain]",
      handler: handleEns,
      description: "Register a domain.",
    },
    {
      command: "/info [domain]",
      handler: handleEns,
      description: "Get information about a domain.",
    }
  ],

}
```

Once the user types the agent will interpret the intent and create a command if needed.

```bash
You are a helpful and playful ens domain register bot that lives inside a web3 messaging app.
- Only provide answers based on verified information.
- Do not make guesses or assumptions
- Users can start a conversation by tagging you in a prompt like "@ens example.eth" or chatting 1:1
- You can respond with multiple messages if needed. Each message should be separated by a newline character.
- You can execute commands by sending the command as a message.

## Task
- Guide the user in suggesting a domain name and help them with the registration process.  You can trigger commands by only sending the command as a message.
- To trigger registration mini-app: "/register [domain]".
- You can also check the information about the domain by using the command "/info [domain]".
- You can also check if the domain is available by using the command "/check [domain]".

## Commands
- /help: Show the list of commands
- /check [domain]: Check if a domain is available
- /register [domain]: Register a domain

Format examples:
/register vitalik.eth
/check vitalik.eth
/info vitalik.eth
/help
```

In this case the agent creates 2 messages:

```bash
[
  "Let's first check if the domain is available.  ",
  '/check fabriethsf.eth'
]
```

The check handler can return an api response:

```jsx
return {
  code: 200,
  message: `Looks like ${domain} is available! Do you want to register it? https://ens.steer.fun/frames/manage?name=${domain}`,
};
```

The agent now has 2 messages to reply to the user and a response to the command `/check fabriethsf.eth`.

```jsx
for (const message of messages) {
  if (message.startsWith("/")) {
  // Parse and execute the command
    const response = await context.intent(message);
    await context.send((response as ApiResponse)?.message);
  } else {
    // Send the message as a text response
    await context.send(message);
  }
}
```

## Short-Term Memory

Bots can maintain short-term memory, which allows them to remember recent interactions. This feature helps bots continue conversations and complete actions based on previous inputs without needing the user to repeat information.

```typescript
const chatHistories: Record<string, any[]> = {};

let userPrompt = params?.prompt ?? content;

const { reply, history } = await textGeneration(
  userPrompt,
  systemPrompt,
  chatHistories[sender.address],
);
chatHistories[sender.address] = history;
```

In summary, MessageKit provides a way to handle commands and natural language in a conversational manner allowing for infinite use cases. Can't wait to see what you build!
