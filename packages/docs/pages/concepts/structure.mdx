# Structure

## File structure

Each app consists of the following files:

```
app-project/              # Optional middleware files
├── src/
│   └── index.ts          # Entry point for your app. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│   └── skills.ts       # Commands for your app. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
├── tsconfig.json         // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
├── package.json          // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
└── .env                  # Environment variables
```

## Main code

The `index.ts` file is the entry point for your app. It should contain something like the following:

```tsx [src/index.ts]
import { run, HandlerContext } from "@xmtp/message-kit";

run(async (context: HandlerContext) => {
  // Get the message and the address from the sender
  const { content, sender } = context.message;

  // To reply, just call `reply` on the HandlerContext.
  await context.send(`gm`);
});
```

## Commands

Each app can have a `skills.ts` file that contains the available commands for the users. The commands are defined as an array of objects with the following structure:

```tsx [src/skills.ts]
export const commands: AgentSkill[] = [
  {
    name: "General Commands",
    description: "Command for managing default behaviours.",
    commands: [
      {
        command: "/help",
        triggers: ["/help"],
        handler: undefined,
        description: "Get help with the app.",
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

## Environment variables

Each app should have an `.env` file that contains the following:

```bash [.env]
KEY= # the private key of the bot wallet, like any normal wallet private key.
```

### Optional parameters

MessageKit uses by default the ENV private key, but you can send messageKit a private key as a parameter.

```jsx
run(
  async (context) => {
    // Your code here
  },
  { privateKey: "your_private_key", experimental: true, attachments: true },
);
```

- `privateKey`: the private key of the bot wallet, like any normal wallet private key.
- `experimental`: experimental features like logging all group messages. Default is `false`.
- `attachments`: to receive attachments. Default is `false`.
- `client`: Optional parameters to pass to the XMTP client.
-

### Export other clients

You can export other clients on run time by importing the `xmtpClient` function.

```jsx
import { xmtpClient } from "@xmtp/message-kit";

const { v2client: newClient } = await xmtpClient({
  privateKey: /*Your private key*/,
  /*optional parameters*/
});
```

For example in the [Cron](/middlewares/cron) middleware, we use the `xmtpClient` function to create a new client and send messages to the users.
