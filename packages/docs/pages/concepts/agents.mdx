# Agents

Agents have context of the group and commands. They can be used to make actions based on those commands or anything you want.

## Create an agent

First think of which handle you want to create. For example

```bash [cmd]
@agent [prompt]
```

Create the command file `agents.ts` in your project root `src` folder.

```tsx [src/index.ts]
// Define agent handlers
const agentHandlers: AgentHandlers = {
  "@agent": agent,
};

// App configuration
const appConfig = {
  commands: /*Your commands the agent can handle*/,
  commandHandlers: /*Your command handlers the agent can use*/,
  agentHandlers: agentHandlers, /*Your agent handlers*/
};

// Run the app
run(async (context: HandlerContext) => {
  /*Your logic here*/
}, appConfig);
```

_Refer to commands [here](/concepts/content-types/command) to see how to define commands._

## Handle prompts

To handle what the agent does, we are going to use GPT-4o:

- `userPrompt`: The prompt the user sends to the agent.
- `systemPrompt`: The system prompt for the agent.

```tsx
const { reply, history } = await openaiCall(userPrompt, systemPrompt);

// if the reply starts with a command, handle the command and return its result
if (reply.startsWith("/")) {
  context.handleCommand(reply);
} else {
  // otherwise, reply to the user with the reply from the agent
  await context.reply(reply);
}
```
