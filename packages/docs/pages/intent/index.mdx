# Intent

MessageKit **Intent** allows bots to interpret and execute commands internally, giving them the ability to process user requests in a conversational manner.

## Handle intent

To parse a string and execute a command handler, you can use the following method. When using responses from LLMs, you may want to execute the intent of the generated commands. This method will parse commands or send chained messages if they are in an array.

```jsx
//Sepcifify the conversation
context.intent("/send 10 usdc to @alix", conv);
// open ai call
const { reply } = await textGeneration(response, prompt);
//Process the intent or an array of intents
context.intent(reply);
```
