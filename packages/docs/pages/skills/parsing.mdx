## Parsing

Parsing enables your bot to understand human-like requests and translate them into precise skill.

## How it works

Imagine your users chatting with your bot as naturally as texting a friend.

:::steps

### User request

```bash
/check vitalik.eth
```

### Parsing

This is the parameters extracted from the user request:

```json
{
  "skill": "check",
  "params": {
    "domain": "vitalik.eth"
  }
}
```

### Handler

```tsx
const {
  message: {
    sender,
    content: { skill, params },
  },
} = context;

if (skill == "check") {
  const { domain } = params;
  const data = await getUserInfo(domain);
  if (!data?.address) {
    let message = `Looks like ${domain} is available! Here you can register it: ${ensUrl}${domain} or would you like to see some cool alternatives?`;
    return {
      code: 200,
      message,
    };
  } else {
    let message = `Looks like ${domain} is already registered!`;
    await context.executeSkill("/cool " + domain);
    return {
      code: 404,
      message,
    };
  }
}
```
