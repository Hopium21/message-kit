## Natural language

Bots can also understand natural language prompts, allowing users to interact with the bot more conversationally. The bot translates the user's natural language input into a command and executes it.

### Example:

A user types:

```bash
@swap 1 usdc to eth please
```

The message will trigger an AI text generation model to convert the natural language to a command.

```bash
You are a helpful and playful betting bot that lives inside a web3 messaging group.

Users can start a swap by tagging you in a prompt like "@swap 1 eth to usdc"

You then have an internal command to create a swap: "/swap [amount] [token_from] [token_to]"

Format examples:
/swap 1 eth usdc
/swap 100 dai usdc
/swap 0.1 eth usdt
```

The AI model will return this command:

```bash
/swap 1 usdc eth
```

And then the bot using `skill` will execute the command. Internally MessageKit will execute the handler `handleSwap` for the command as defined in the commands file seen before.

```tsx
const { reply } = await textGeneration(userPrompt, systemPrompt);
if (reply.startsWith("/")) {
  // Execute the command if it's a slash command
  await context.skill(reply);
}
```
