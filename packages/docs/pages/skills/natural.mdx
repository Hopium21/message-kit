## Natural language parsing

Transform your bot into a conversational genius! Natural language processing enables your bot to understand human-like requests and translate them into precise skill.

## How it works

Imagine your users chatting with your bot as naturally as texting a friend.

```bash
@swap 1 usdc to eth please
```

The bot uses AI to understand casual requests. Here's the secret sauce:

```tsx
const systemPrompt = `
You're a friendly web3 swap assistant living in group chats!

I understand casual requests like:
- "@swap 1 eth to usdc"
- "hey bot, swap 2 dai for eth"
- "convert 0.5 usdc to eth please"

I'll convert these into structured skills like:
/swap [amount] [token_from] [token_to]

Examples:
/swap 1 eth usdc    // Swapping 1 ETH to USDC
/swap 100 dai usdc  // Converting 100 DAI to USDC
/swap 0.1 eth usdt  // Trading 0.1 ETH for USDT
`;
```

And the magic happens:

```tsx
// The AI processes the request and returns a structured skill
const { reply } = await textGeneration(userPrompt, systemPrompt);

// If it's a valid skill, execute it!
if (reply.startsWith("/")) {
  await context.executeSkill(reply);
}
```

## Example:

::::steps

### User request

```bash
@swap 1 usdc eth please
```

### Prompt parsing

```tsx
const { reply } = await textGeneration(userPrompt, systemPrompt);
// /swap 1 usdc eth
```

### Returning a response

The bot can return a structured response to the user and then handle the response in the skill handler.

```tsx
import { SkillResponse } from "@xmtp/message-kit";

// If it's a valid skil, execute it!
if (reply.startsWith("/")) {
  const response = (await context.executeSkill(reply)) as SkillResponse;
  if (response.code == 200) await context.send(response.message);
}
```

### Example response:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "message": "https://base-tx-frame.vercel.app/transaction?transactionType=swap&amount=1&token_from=usdc&token_to=eth"
}
```

### Pro tips

- Your bot can handle various casual phrases
- Users don't need to remember exact skill syntax
- Natural language makes your bot more approachable
- Add personality to your system prompt for extra flair!
- Use the `SkillResponse` type to handle the response from the skill handler.
- Handle all possible responses from the skill handler.
- Use the `SkillResponse` as if they were a normal API response.
