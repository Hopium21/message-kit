## Short-Term Memory

Bots can maintain short-term memory, which allows them to remember recent interactions. This feature helps bots continue conversations and complete actions based on previous inputs without needing the user to repeat information.

```typescript
const chatHistories: Record<string, any[]> = {};

let userPrompt = params?.prompt ?? content;

const { reply, history } = await textGeneration(
  userPrompt,
  systemPrompt,
  chatHistories[sender.address],
);
chatHistories[sender.address] = history;
```

In summary, MessageKit provides a way to handle commands and natural language in a conversational manner allowing for infinite use cases. Can't wait to see what you build!
