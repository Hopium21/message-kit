# Skills

MessageKit **Skills** allows bots to interpret and execute commands internally, giving them the ability to process user requests in a conversational manner.

## Handle skills

To parse a string and execute a command handler, you can use the following method. When using responses from LLMs, you may want to execute the skill of the generated commands. This method will parse commands or send chained messages if they are in an array.

```jsx
//Sepcifify the command
const { message } = await context.skill("/send 10 usdc to @alix", conv);
context.send(message);
```
