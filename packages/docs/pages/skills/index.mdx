# AI Skills

MessageKit's AI Skills system enables bots to understand and process skills through multiple intelligence layers, creating more natural and powerful conversational experiences.

## Introduction to AI Skills

MessageKit steps to create fully functional AI agents that perform complex tasks:

:::steps

### 1. Command Processing

Bots can execute structured skills with parameter validation and type checking:

```jsx
// Execute a simple command
const { message } = await context.skill("/send 10 usdc to @alix", conv);
context.send(message);
```

Learn more about [command processing](/skills/commands)

### 2. Natural Language Understanding

Bots can interpret casual human language and convert it to executable skills:

User:

```bash
@swap 1 usdc to eth please".
```

Bot:

```bash
/swap 1 usdc eth
```

### 3. Multi line

User:

```
I want to check if vitalik.eth is available
```

This will return an array of messages, and then it will process each one sequentially:

```tsx [gpt.ts]
[" Let me check that domain for you", "/check vitalik.eth"];
```

### 4. Reasoning

Bots can manage complex workflows by:

- Breaking down tasks into steps
- Maintaining conversation context
- Executing sequential commands
- Waiting for user input when needed

Example of a multi-step ENS registration flow:

```tsx
["Let's first check if the domain is available.  ", "/check fabriethsf.eth"];
["The domain is available!  ", "/register fabriethsf.eth"];
["The domain is registered!  ", "/info fabriethsf.eth"];
```

## 4. Multi-Agent

Multiple specialized bots can work together in the same chat, each handling different aspects of user requests.
