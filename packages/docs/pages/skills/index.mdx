# AI Skills

MessageKit's AI Skills system enables bots to understand and process skills through multiple intelligence layers, creating more natural and powerful conversational experiences.

## Introduction to AI Skills

MessageKit steps to create fully functional AI agents that perform complex tasks:

:::steps

### Reasoning

Bots can manage complex workflows by managing all the concepts below:

- Breaking down tasks into steps
- Maintaining conversation context
- Executing sequential skills
- Waiting for user input when needed

Learn more about [Reasoning](/skills/reasoning).

### Fine Tuning

Get your agent to the next level with fine tuning.

```
1. If the user asks to check a domain like vitalik.eth:
  Hey! ill check that domain for you.\n/check vitalik.eth
```

Learn more about [Fine Tuning](/skills/fine-tuning).

### Processing

User:

```
I want to check if vitalik.eth is available
```

This will return an array of messages, and then it will process each one sequentially:

```tsx [gpt.ts]
["Let me check that domain for you", "/check vitalik.eth"];
```

### Parsing

Bots can interpret casual human language and convert it to executable skills:

User request:

```bash
/check vitalik.eth
```

Parsing:

This is the parameters extracted from the user request:

```json
{
  "skill": "check",
  "params": {
    "domain": "vitalik.eth"
  }
}
```

### Definition

Bots can execute structured skills with parameter validation and type checking:

```jsx
// Execute a simple skill
const { message } = await context.executeSkill("/send 10 usdc to @alix", conv);
context.send(message);
```
